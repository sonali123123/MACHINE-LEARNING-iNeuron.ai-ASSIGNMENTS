    "Ans1. Prior probability is the probability an event will happen before you take any new evidence into account. You can think of posterior probability as an adjustment on prior probability.  For example, historical data suggests that around 50% of students who start college will graduate within 4 years. This is the prior probability. \n",

    "Ans: Naive Bayes is a simple and powerful algorithm for predictive modeling. Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems."

    "### 8. Write any two strengths of Bayes classifier ?\n",
    "Ans: This algorithm works quickly and can save a lot of time. Naive Bayes is suitable for solving multi-class prediction problems. If its assumption of the independence of features holds true, it can perform better than other models and requires much less training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It is simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "2) It doesn't require as much training data.\n",
    "3) It handles both continuous and discrete data.\n",
    "4) It is highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points.\n",
    "5) It is fast and can be used to make real-time predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Write any two weaknesses of Bayes classifier ?\n",
    "Ans: The greatest weakness of the naïve Bayes classifier is that it relies on an often-faulty assumption of equally important and independent features which results in biased posterior probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your test data set has a categorical variable of a category that wasn’t present in the training data set, the Naive Bayes model will assign it zero probability and won’t be able to make any predictions in this regard. This phenomenon is called ‘Zero Frequency,’ and you’ll have to use a smoothing technique to solve this problem.\n",
    "This algorithm is also notorious as a lousy estimator. So, you shouldn’t take the probability outputs of ‘predict_proba’ too seriously.\n",
    "It assumes that all the features are independent. While it might sound great in theory, in real life, you’ll hardly find a set of independent features.\n",

    "1) Text classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier that classifies based on probabilities of events. It is the applied commonly to text classification. With the training set, we can train a Naive Bayes classifier which we can use to automaticall categorize a new sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Spam filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Market sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Sentiment analysis is a field dedicated to extracting subjective emotions and feelings from text. One common use of sentiment analysis is to figure out if a text expresses negative or positive feelings. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for classifying text."
