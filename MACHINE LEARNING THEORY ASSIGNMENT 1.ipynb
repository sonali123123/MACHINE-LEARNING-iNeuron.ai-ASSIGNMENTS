    "Ans: Learning algorithm that relies on a similarity measure to make predictions is Instance Based Algorithm. The Machine Learning systems which are categorized as instance-based learning are the systems that learn the training examples by heart and then generalizes to new instances based on some similarity measure. It is called instance-based because it builds the hypotheses from the training instances. It is also known as memory-based learning or lazy-learning. The time complexity of this algorithm depends upon the size of training data. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O (n), where n is the number of training instances.\n",

This requires a measure of resemblance between two emails. A similarity measure between two emails could be the same sender or the repetitive use of the same keywords or something else."

    "### Q12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm ?\n",
    "Ans: Model parameter determines how a model will predict given a new instance. Model usually has more than one parameter (i.e. slope of a linear model). Hyperparameter is a parameter for the learning algorithm, not of a model. Model parameters are estimated based on the data during model training and model hyperparameters are set manually and are used in processes to help estimate model parameters. Model hyperparameters are often referred to as parameters because they are the parts of the machine learning that must be set manually and tuned."

    "### Q13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions ?\n",
    "Ans: Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function. The goal for a model-based algorithm is to be able to generalize to new examples. To do this, model based algorithms search for optimal values for the model's parameters, often called theta. This searching, or \"learning\", is what machine learning is all about. Model-based system learn by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predicitons on new data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make a prediction, a new instance's features are fed into a hypothesis function which uses the minimized theta found by repeatedly running the cost function."

    "Ans: Test set is a set to test your model (fit using training data) to see how it performs.Test set is necessary to determine how good (or bad) a model performs. When we want to know how well our model generalizes to new cases we prefer to use a test set instead of actually deploying the system. To build the test set we split the training data (50-50, 60-40, 80-20 are common splits) into a training set and test set. Our model is training with the training set. Then we use the model to run predictions on the test set. Our error rate on the test set is called the generalization error or out-of-sample error. This error tells us how well our model performs on examples it has never seen before.\n",

    "### Q17.What is a validation set's purpose ?\n",
    "Ans: Validation set is a set used to compare between different training models. Let's say we have a linear model and we want to perform some hyperparameter tuning to reduce the generalization error. One way to do this 100 different models with 100 different hyperparameter values using the training set and finding the generalization error with the test set. You find the best hyperparameter value gives you 5% generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you launch the model into production and find you're seeing 15% generalization error. This isn't going as expected. What happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that for each iteration of hyperparameter tuning, you measured the generalization error then updated the model using the same test set. In other words, your produced the best generalization error for the test set. The test set no longer represents cases the model hasn't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution to this problem is to have a second holdout set called the validation set. You train multiple models with various hyperparameters using the training set, you select the model and hyperparameters that perform best on the validation set, and when you are happy about your model you run a single final test against the test set to get an estimate of the generalization error.\n",

    "### Q18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use ?\n",
    "Ans: Cross-validation is a tool to compare models without needing a separate validation set. It is preferred over validation set because we can save from breaking of part of the training set to create a validation set, as having more data is valuable regardless.\n",

    "Ans: If you tune hyperparameters using the test sets, then it may not perform well on the out-of-sample data because the model is tuned just for that specific set. Our model will not be generalizable to new examples."
