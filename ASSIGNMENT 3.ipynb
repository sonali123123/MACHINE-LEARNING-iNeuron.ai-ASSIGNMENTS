    "Under the supervision of experts: Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation Concept Learning.\n",

    "With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner: Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance Operant Conditioning.\n",

    "Ans: Imagine a dataset as a table, where the rows are each observation (aka measurement, data point, etc), and the columns for each observation represent the features of that observation and their values.At the outset of a machine learning project, a dataset is usually split into two or three subsets. The minimum subsets are the training and test datasets, and often an optional third validation dataset is created as well. Once these data subsets are created from the primary dataset, a predictive model or classifier is trained using the training data, and then the model’s predictive accuracy is determined using the test data. As, machine learning leverages algorithms to automatically model and find patternsin data, usually with the goal of predicting some target output or response. These algorithms are heavily based on statistics and mathematical optimization. Optimization is the process of finding the smallest or largest value (minima or maxima) of a function, often referred to as a loss, or cost function in the minimization case. One of the most popular optimization algorithms used in machine learning is called gradient descent, and another is known as the the normal equation. In a nutshell, machine learning is all about automatically learning a highly accurate predictive or classifier model, or finding unknown patterns in data, by leveraging learning algorithms and optimization techniques.\n",

    "Deep learning applications in healthcare: Deep learning provides the healthcare industry with the ability to analyze data at exceptional speeds without compromising on accuracy. It’s not machine learning, nor is it AI, it’s an elegant blend of both that uses a layered algorithmic architecture to sift through data at an astonishing rate. The benefits of deep learning in healthcare are plentiful – fast, efficient, accurate – but they don’t stop there. Even more benefits lie within the neural networks formed by multiple layers of AI and ML and their ability to learn. Yes, the secret to deep learning’s success is in the name – learning.\n",
